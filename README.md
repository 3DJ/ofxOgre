ofxOgre
=======
openframeworks addons for ogre.

ofxOgre lets ogre work in openframeworks.

*******
1. You don't need to download the ogre sdk on windowsx, but you need to install ogre on linux for running ofxOgre.
2. cfg has the default cfg file from ogre sdk. Copy it to your "bin" folder for initializing ogre if you don't have your own ogre cfg file.

Tested on windows7 32bit(openframeworks0073/0074, ogre 1.8), Ubuntu12.04(openframeworks0073, ogre 1.74)
If you are using ogre 1.8 on linux, please copy the lib/plugin*.so to your bin folder manually.

If you have any problem on using this, email us by team@3-dj.com
